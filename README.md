**Task
TEST CASE 1 - PRICING RULES
We'd like you to complete a small coding task to get to know better your approach to problem solving. The task

● In addition to the code solution, please also give a bit of background information about why you think
your solution is appropriate and how it might probably be extended further. Also p
